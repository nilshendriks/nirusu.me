      Amidst the upheaval of the 2020 Corona Lockdown, I embarked on a personal
      mini project that became a testament to resilience: Lockdown Portraits.
      These are not just photos; they are glimpses into the lives of real
      people‚Äîindividuals navigating the challenges and triumphs that isolation
      brings.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each portrait tells a story, not of models, but of everyday heroes facing
      the ordeals of lockdown with courage and grace. To add depth to the visual
      narrative, I posed two questions to each participant, unearthing personal
      insights that accompany their portraits.

      Sparkling Banana Girl.

          I‚Äôve noticed that I can‚Äôt work and take care simultaneously and
          maintain my sanity, which requires flexibility from my employer in
          terms of expectations and from myself. Luckily, my job already allowed

          and limiting contact, can draw me inward from time to time, which is
          not always good. I‚Äôm a thinker and my thoughts can cause my braincells
          to work overtime. Luckily, most of my thoughts are positive and
          lockdown has pushed me to take things a bit slower, to re-prioritize

          my spending, health, body and life in general. I realize that I love
          spending time with my kid in different ways. For sure, I can‚Äôt wait
          for the school and day-care to open again, don‚Äôt get me wrong; I‚Äôm not
          the stay-at-home-mom kinda type. But I‚Äôm sort of happy that I have
