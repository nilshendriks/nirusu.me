      Amidst the upheaval of the 2020 Corona Lockdown, I embarked on a personal
      mini project that became a testament to resilience: Lockdown Portraits.
      These are not just photos; they are glimpses into the lives of real
      people—individuals navigating the challenges and triumphs that isolation
      brings.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each portrait tells a story, not of models, but of everyday heroes facing
      the ordeals of lockdown with courage and grace. To add depth to the visual
      narrative, I posed two questions to each participant, unearthing personal
      insights that accompany their portraits.

          Our society and our life is so much focused on 'doing', through the
          lockdown we learn to distance ourselves and just let it 'happen'. I
          think that is a great development.

          confused and angry emotions ("I want to be able to decide what I do
          myself"), but soon I also noticed a feeling of resignation. It felt
          like more breathing space and space to reflect. A certain excitement,
          a rush and a pressure to want to do as many things as possible in one
          day, I saw in myself from before the time of the lockdown.</q>
      </p>
      <p>
        My days were filled with social interactions with people, from the
        beginning to the end of the day I was surrounded with colleagues,
        customers, friends, people at the gym. I am a social person, but I
        actually felt less social by seeing and talking to so many people in one
        day.
      </p>
      <p>
        During the time of the lockdown I started to withdraw and now I spend
        much more time alone in my room, so I can recharge myself. If I then go
        outside and meet people again, that changes the way I experience
        everything. I am fresher and more open to everything, which means that I
        can enjoy my environment and contacts more.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the same time, it is deep in me to want to develop further and to
        commit myself to something that makes me feel satisfied. Before the
        lockdown, I had recently graduated and I started looking for the next
        step. Corona has taken this in a different direction, because there are
        simply fewer options with regard to jobs and studying. I started
        applying to several aid agencies, also for voluntary work, I even sent a
        message to the UMC because I would like to dedicate myself to aftercare
        for ex-corona patients, but I get almost no response. I find that
        difficult.

          And that I can also allow myself those me-time moments. Our society
          and our life is so much focused on 'doing', through the lockdown we
          learn to distance ourselves and just let it 'happen'. I think that is
          a great development.</q

        I hope it teaches us and myself to take a different perspective of the
        world, that we are not as important as we think, and that there are no
        differences between us. We are all victims and that creates more
        connection with each other and hopefully also with the world.
