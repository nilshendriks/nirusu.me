            During the Corona Lockdown 2020 I came up with this personal mini project: Lockdown Portraits, showing real people – not models – and how they deal with all the ordeals that isolation brings with it. Accompanying the photos are 2 questions I asked each one of them and their answers.

          p.nh-txt-question can you describe to what extent <br />the lockdown has affected your life and how?<br /> both on a personal and professional level?
          p.nh-txt-quote
            q We are in the luxury position that we have little trouble. Thinking of parents with several children, 3-high, nursing home residents, the lonely and the needy. We have each other and have always been on our own. Our dog, Wouke, ensures that we can take to the streets 4 times a day without shame.

            | As far as my work in health care is concerned, there was much confusion and contradiction in behavior around distance and proximity.

          p.nh-txt-question if anything, what do you think <br />will you take away from all this.<br />any lessons learned?
          p.nh-txt-quote
            q I think we will never be so lighthearted in the event of a virus outbreak again.
