          During the Corona Lockdown 2020 I came up with this personal mini project: Lockdown Portraits, showing real people – not models – and how they deal with all the ordeals that isolation brings with it. Accompanying the photos are 2 questions I asked each one of them and their answers.

        p.nh-txt-question can you describe to what extent <br />the lockdown has affected your life and how?<br /> both on a personal and professional level?
        p.nh-txt-quote
          q In these times you cherish what you have been given in life. This may sound sappy and rest assured, it is. I am grateful that I still can go to work and come home to my family.

        p.nh-txt-question if anything, what do you think <br />will you take away from all this.<br />any lessons learned?
