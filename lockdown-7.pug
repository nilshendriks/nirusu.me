            During the Corona Lockdown 2020 I came up with this personal mini project: Lockdown Portraits, showing real people – not models – and how they deal with all the ordeals that isolation brings with it. Accompanying the photos are 2 questions I asked each one of them and their answers.

          p.nh-txt-question can you describe to what extent <br />the lockdown has affected your life and how?<br /> both on a personal and professional level?
          p.nh-txt-quote
            q So.. 2 weeks before the lockdown I finished the renovation of my beauty shop .. everything was brand new.. I spent all my savings on the salon and I had to close it. I tried not to panic though I had a few ups and downs in the first week. After i calmed down I was just happy to be at home with my kids and husband. We never had this freedom here in Holland. Doing nothing and even getting some money . So we had some quality family time together.

          p.nh-txt-question if anything, what do you think <br />will you take away from all this.<br />any lessons learned?
          p.nh-txt-quote
            q The lesson I learnt that fear is the biggest power in this world. I distanced myself from it and not let myself be influenced by the media, TV or by other people. I will continue this way.
