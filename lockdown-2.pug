            During the Corona Lockdown 2020 I came up with this personal mini project: Lockdown Portraits, showing real people â€“ not models â€“ and how they deal with all the ordeals that isolation brings with it. Accompanying the photos are 2 questions I asked each one of them and their answers. Second in this series was Niki: entrepreneur and coach.

          p.nh-txt-question can you describe to what extent <br />the lockdown has affected your life and how?<br /> both on a personal and professional level?
          p.nh-txt-quote
            q In terms of my professional life there has been some changes. All of my business and bodywork trainings and coaching sessions have been cancelled. I switched to online coaching and focusing on helping people to face challenges during crisis.<br /><br />On a personal level the biggest change is the lack of face to face contact with my friends, colleagues and clients. As I am a pretty active person and travel a lot, it has been a challenge first how to rearrange my life.
          p.nh-txt-question if anything, what do you think <br />will you take away from all this.<br />any lessons learned?
          p.nh-txt-quote
            q There are many lessons learnt....as people spend more time alone or with their direct family they need(ed) to face certain issues, fears, values they tried to avoid through a busy life. If we spend more quality time inwards with ourselves without crisis, we have more peace and balance as well in any crisis.<br /><br />Itâ€™s a mind game ðŸ§
