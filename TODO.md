# TODO 

- redo README.md
- update browserslist / caniuse
- stylelint?
- formatting? prettier?
- think bout photo -> lightbox : like now or with modal or new page / detail page / view transition.

- resize images correctly?
  - my screen is 1920px wide
  - 1 photo is 450x450 = 900px for 2x screens
  - use 450px for mobile as well?
  - real size of image is now: 1960px x 1960px (probably for the lightbox version)
  - on my screen the lightbox version is displayed at: 980 x 980 = 1960px 2x 
  - someone suggests to use these standard sizes: 320w, 640w, 960w, 1280w, 1920w, and 2560w
  - first do jpg only: 450, 900, 980, 1960?
