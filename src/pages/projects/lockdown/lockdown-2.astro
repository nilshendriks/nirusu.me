            Amidst the upheaval of the 2020 Corona Lockdown, I embarked on a
            personal mini project that became a testament to resilience:
            Lockdown Portraits. These are not just photos; they are glimpses
            into the lives of real peopleâ€”individuals navigating the challenges
            and triumphs that isolation brings.
        </p>
        <p>
            Each portrait tells a story, not of models, but of everyday heroes
            facing the ordeals of lockdown with courage and grace. To add depth
            to the visual narrative, I posed two questions to each participant,
            unearthing personal insights that accompany their portraits.
        </p>
        <p>Second in this series was Niki: entrepreneur and coach.</p>

                    changes. All of my business and bodywork trainings and
                    coaching sessions have been cancelled. I switched to online
                    coaching and focusing on helping people to face challenges
                    during crisis. On a personal level the biggest change is the
                    lack of face to face contact with my friends, colleagues and
                    clients. As I am a pretty active person and travel a lot, it
                    has been a challenge first how to rearrange my life.</q

            <!--<p class="nh-txt-quote"><q>On a personal level Iâ€™d say that for me it hasnâ€™t had a big impact yet as I feel Iâ€™ve lived in a less strict sort of lockdown for close to a year now due to various reasons. On the other hand now it is much more strict of course and also more out of my control. Ironically that last part can also be very liberating as thereâ€™s no point in fighting it so you might as well just go with it. For me that comes down to forcing myself to come up with new ways of doing things, keeping busy, distracted sometimes even.</q></p>-->
